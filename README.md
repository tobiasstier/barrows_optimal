# Barrows Optimal Money Making Helper

From the wiki:

> Capping the Reward Potential at 880 points (shows as 86.8% in game) will maximise the amount of awarded runes, while ruling out the possibility of receiving bolt racks, half keys and dragon med helms. This will improve the average value of the rewards. This can be done by killing:
>* 6 brothers, 1 giant crypt spider, 1 skeleton, and 1 crypt spider (880 points).
>* 6 brothers, 1 giant crypt spider, 1 skeleton, and 1 bloodworm (876 points).
>* 6 brothers, 2 skeletons and 1 crypt spider (878 points).
>* 6 brothers, 2 skeletons and 1 bloodworm (874 points).
>* 6 brothers, 3 bloodworms and 1 crypt spider (880 points).
>* 6 brothers and 4 bloodworms (876 points).

This plugin will help keep track of what kind of mobs to be killed to ensure maximum profit.
